"In this assignment you'll experiment with different implementations of a simulated restriction enzyme cutting (or cleaving) a DNA molecule. Three scientists shared the Nobel Prize in 1978 for the discovery of restriction enzymes. They're also an essential part of the process called PCR polymerase chain reaction which is one of the most significant discoveries/inventions in chemistry and for which Kary Mullis won the Nobel Prize in 1993.

Kary Mullis, the inventor of PCR, is an interesting character. To see more about him see this archived copy of a 1992 interview in Omni Magazine or his personal website which includes information about his autobiography Dancing Naked in the Mind Field, though you can read this free Nobel autobiography as well.

The simulation is a simplification of the chemical process, but provides an example of the utility of linked lists in implementing a data structure. The linked list code you'll write and reason about is an example of a chunk list. The timing and memory differences between using linked lists and using efficient strings are remarkable!"
